# Mario is Missing

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Randomization randomizes the locations of Artifacts, and optionally the city each door leads to.

## What is the goal of Mario is Missing when randomized?
The goal is to return the defined number of Artifacts and enter the door on the top floor of Bowser's Castle to rescue Mario.

## What items and locations get shuffled?
Each city is being terrorized by Koopas. Three of them are holding stolen artifacts, and each one recovered grants a check.
Additionally, once an artifact is returned to its proper place, a photograph can be taken at that location, which also grants a check.
Optionally, every piece of advice that can be logged in the computer can also grant checks.

Each of the 45 unique artifacts are in the item pool. Also in the pool are Castle Floor Keys, which are required
to unlock the next floor of the castle.
Photographs, Newspaper, and Advice do nothing.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
All items can be placed in other worlds.

## What does another world's item look like in Mario is Missing?
Items do not have an appearance in Mario is Missing

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
A sound is played and the player will be either to enter the next floor, or
see they have the artifact in its corresponding city.
